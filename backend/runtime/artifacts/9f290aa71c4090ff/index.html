Here's a detailed explanation of quantum mechanics:

- **Fundamental theory** in physics describing nature at smallest scales (atoms, subatomic particles)
- **Replaces classical mechanics** at microscopic levels where classical physics fails
- **Based on quantized properties** where energy/momentum come in discrete packets (quanta)
- **Probabilistic nature** - outcomes are probabilities rather than certainties

## Key Principles

### 1. Wave-Particle Duality
Particles like electrons and photons exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behavior. They can behave as discrete particles in some experiments and as waves in others.

### 2. Quantization
Physical properties (energy, angular momentum) can only take specific discrete values rather than continuous ranges. Electrons in atoms occupy specific energy levels.

### 3. Uncertainty Principle (Heisenberg)
You cannot simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

### 4. Superposition
Quantum systems can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. A quantum bit (qubit) can be 0 and 1 at the same time.

### 5. Entanglement
When particles become linked, measuring one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance. This "spooky action at a distance" challenges classical notions of locality.

## Mathematical Framework
- **Wave function (Ψ)** describes quantum state
- **Schrödinger equation** governs how wave functions evolve
- **Probability density** = |Ψ|² gives probability of finding particle at location

## Applications
- **Semiconductors** and transistors (computers, electronics)
- **Lasers** and LED technology
- **MRI** medical imaging
- **Quantum computing** (in development)
- **Cryptography** and secure communications

## Key Differences from Classical Physics
- **Probabilistic vs deterministic** outcomes
- **Non-local correlations** through entanglement
- **Measurement affects system** (observer effect)
- **Tunneling** - particles passing through barriers

Quantum mechanics remains one of the most successful and accurately tested theories in science, though its philosophical interpretations (Copenhagen, many-worlds, etc.) continue to be debated.[DONE][DONE]
